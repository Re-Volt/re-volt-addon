# Installation

To install the add-on, locate the `addons` folder within your Blender configuration folder.

In most cases, it is located at `C:\Users\<your-user>\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons\`.

If you're on GNU/Linux, your add-on folder should be located at `~/.config/blender/2.79/scripts/addons/`, where `2.79` is the **Blender version you are using**.  

For more information, see [Configuring Directories â€• Blender Manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/getting_started/installing/configuration/directories.html).

Extract the `io_revolt` folder into the addons folder.
