Version [`rva_18.0619`](https://github.com/Yethiel/re-volt-addon/releases/tag/rva_18.0619)

**Topics**: Bugfixes

- **Fixes**
    - Support loading files with uppercase letters
    - Throw an error message when exceeding polygon/vertex limits for meshes
    - Activate NCP no-collision flag (reported by Kiwi)

    - Inverted alpha vertex color layer: Black is translucent, white is opaque. I've done this to resemble the behavior of pure black on textures.

## 2018-04-30

Version [`rva_18.0430`](https://github.com/Yethiel/re-volt-addon/releases/tag/rva_18.0430)

**Topics**: Instance (.fin), UI, Bugfixes

- **Additions**
    - **Instances (.fin)**: Export (full support)
    - *Select by name* button in the Instances panel that allows users to select all objects with a similar name
    - *Mark as Instance* button in the Instances panel that sets the instance properties on all selected objects
    - *Batch baking* feature for instance RGB in the Instances panel
    - **Initial hull support**: Import (unfinished)
- **Fixes**
    - Textures are now loaded when importing a mesh from the custom folder (reported by Gotolei)
    - Ensure that NCP layers exist when exporting: All Material layers and Type layers are now kept. This fixes missing materials when exporting NCP. (reported by LoScassatore, Gorgonzola)
    - Export of textures with suffixes like .bmp.001 (reported by Boy80)
- **Modifications**
    - Moved the instances helper section to a dedicated Instances panel.
    - Objects marked as instance (*Is Instance*) will no longer be exported when exporting to .w, use .fin instead
    - Fixed all Re-Volt panels to the top (object and scene properties) so they're easier to find. This makes the add-on a lot more intrusive but most people using this add-on use Blender exclusively for Re-Volt.
    - Message boxes for confirming actions in the helpers panel
    - Texture number face property only shows when *Use Number for Textures* option is enabled
    - *Prefer Solid Textured Mode* is now disabled by default

    - **Re-Export Button**: Press the button next to the Export button to export to the same file again.
- **Fixes**
    - The vertex color picker now picks from selected faces *or* vertices. (Contribution by Boy80)

- **Additions**
    - **NCP** (collision): Import and export is now supported. The face properties panel has a section for NCP now (face flags and materials).
